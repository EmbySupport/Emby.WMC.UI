# Welcome to the WMC UI Public Beta! <img src="https://github.com/EmbySupport/Emby.WMC.UI/assets/4985349/b55bb640-17ae-447d-9b16-51b474aebc59" alt="EmbyButton7" style="float: right; max-width: 100%;">    

Thanks for your interest in the WMC UI and for being part of this!

Your help and feedback is important and essential for getting this to perfection and ironing out all those things that one alone can't find and identify as everybody has different setup and different ways of using Emby.

There are two places for interaction and communication:

- [Issue-Tracking](https://github.com/EmbySupport/Emby.WMC.UI/issues)
- [WMC UI Forums](https://emby.media/community/index.php?/forum/187-wmc-ui-beta)

### [Issues](https://github.com/EmbySupport/Emby.WMC.UI/issues)

Issues are used for tracking work that needs to be done

- Please create a new for every problem you see, no matter which kind - can be errors, unexpected behavior, visual glitches, etc.
- Please check first, whether an entry already exists for the same problem
- If you think an existing entry is the same, but the situation is slightly different, you can add a message to the existing issue or create a new one, we'll then find out whether it's different or same

### [WMC UI Forums](https://emby.media/community/index.php?/forum/187-wmc-ui-beta)

  Weâ€™re using the forums as a place for general communication like:
  * Publishing announcements about when updates are published
  * Asking questions about the WMC UI
  * Sharing ideas and suggestions

Please always start a new topic for a new subject and let's try to avoid endless conversations which are "about everything"
